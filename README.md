#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on designing, development, maintenance, and management of software applications and systems.
It aids in the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of our daily life i.e commerce, communication, health just to mention a few.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Internet of things; whereby devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies can connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communication networks
Object-Oriented Programming; a programming paradigm which organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions or logic.
Agile methodologies; emerged to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes by adapting to changing requirements and promoting continuous feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Software development life cycle encompasses the stages through which a software progresses, including requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Planning- This stage involves determining the scope, objective and resources required for a project
Requirements gathering- involves understanding and documenting what the software needs to achieve.
Design- involves creating the specifications through which a software will be built upon.
Coding- Is the actual implementation via writing the software code in accordance to the required specifications.
Testing- involves checking if the software meets the requirements without defects.
Deployment- is where the software is released to the user in a work environment.
Maintenance- involves making updates and fixes after the software is deployed to enhance workability

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a software development approach that follows a set of sequences where one has to end to allow for the next one whereas agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback
This leaves waterfall methodology quite rigid and agile methodology quite flexible in terms of delivery.
Waterfall is best suited for projects with well defined requirements while agile is best suited for programs with evolving requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for the designing, coding and maintenance of a software.
A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software is functioning properly and has met required standards.
A project manager oversees the whole software development process which includes planning, execution and delivery to the relevant stakeholder.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs provide the platform and resources through which software development is done, i.e. coding , debugging and testing software workability. An example being Visual Studio, Dreamweaver.
VCS facilitates effective collaboration, code management, backup, and recovery through version tracking. An example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing requirements; This can be overcome by adapting agile methodology of software development.
Handling Software complexity; This can be overcome by well planning and designing the software step by step.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software.
Integration testing involves testing how different units of the software work together.
System testing evaluates the entire system as a whole, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing verifies whether the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the end-users
Since each methods checks on different aspects, it helps in ensuring comprehensive quality assurance, detect issues early, prevent system wide problems and maintain user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering is the process of creating systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.
This helps to get the best responses from an AI assistant.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Design a website

Design a IT store shopping website with a blue background, where customers can create an account, login, select interested items from a catalog and add to their cart, and allow them to pay via Mpesa.

The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear, actionable details and helps the designer meet required expectations more effectively.
